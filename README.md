#A discord bot to store urls-strings under name

**The default prefix is -- (see config.js)**

**Use** `--help` **to begin to freestyle =)**
**Each command has a help :** `--help command`.


*Tricky stuff*
- I implemented a system with which you can skip the underscore of a command's name : for example `--s_tell` is equivalent to `--s tell`.

*Reading this is not really important, that's story.*

> At first, I wanted to make a music bot, but I didn't succeed. I didn't try so hard because there is a lot of music bots. But I don't want to stick to Youtube to search-copy-paste music vidÃ©os urls.
> My bot's main feature is storing urls under names (in a folder, in **global** by default). Storing is made by `--s register` and accessing by `--s get`, or `--s list`.
